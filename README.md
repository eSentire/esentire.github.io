# Overview
eSentire strives to be an active participant in the open source community because we feel that this global,
community driven approach to solving problems in a transparent way can lead to faster, cost effective, reliable
and secure solutions.

# qspm
The quantum safe password manager is a demonstration webapp that shows how to build a
simple password management system using symmetric key encryption algorithms that
are safe from currently known quantum attacks.

One of the interesting features of this project is the use of Rust to implement the
algorithms that are then converted to the WebAssembly.

Another interesting feature is the use of the Github Workflow Actions service to test
both the Rust code and the web interface.

The project is available [here](https://esentire.github.io/qspm/).
