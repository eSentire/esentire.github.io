# Quantum Safe Password Manager
The quantum safe password manager (qspm) is a demonstration webapp that shows how to build a
simple password management system using symmetric key encryption algorithms that
are safe from currently known quantum attacks.

One of the interesting features of this project is the use of Rust to implement the
algorithms that are then converted to the WebAssembly.

Another interesting feature is the use of the Github Workflow Actions service to test
both the Rust code and the web interface.

The webapp is available [here](https://esentire.github.io/qspm/).
